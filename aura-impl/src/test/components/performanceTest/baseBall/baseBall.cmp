<p><b>Baseball</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games" title="Bat-and-ball games">bat-and-ball sport</a> played between two teams of nine players. The aim is to score <a href="/wiki/Run_(baseball)" title="Run (baseball)">runs</a> by hitting a thrown <a href="/wiki/Baseball_(ball)" title="Baseball (ball)">ball</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Baseball_bat" title="Baseball bat">bat</a> and touching a series of four <a href="/wiki/Base_(baseball)" title="Base (baseball)" class="mw-redirect">bases</a> arranged at the corners of a 90-foot <a href="/wiki/Diamond_(shape)" title="Diamond (shape)" class="mw-redirect">diamond</a>. Players on the <a href="/wiki/Baseball_rules#Batting_team" title="Baseball rules">batting team</a> take turns hitting against the <a href="/wiki/Pitcher" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Baseball_rules#Fielding_team" title="Baseball rules">fielding team</a>, which tries to stop them from scoring runs by getting hitters <a href="/wiki/Out_(baseball)" title="Out (baseball)">out</a> in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammate's <a href="/wiki/Hit_(baseball)" title="Hit (baseball)">hit</a> or other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team constitutes an <a href="/wiki/Inning_(baseball)" title="Inning (baseball)" class="mw-redirect">inning</a> and nine innings make up a professional game. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>Evolving from older bat-and-ball games, an early form of baseball was being played in England by the mid-eighteenth century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, <a href="/wiki/History_of_baseball_in_the_United_States" title="History of baseball in the United States">where the modern version developed</a>. By the late nineteenth century, baseball was widely recognized as the <a href="/wiki/National_sport" title="National sport">national sport</a> of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America, parts of Central and South America and the Caribbean, and parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>In the United States and Canada, professional <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) teams are divided into the <a href="/wiki/National_League" title="National League">National League</a> (NL) and <a href="/wiki/American_League" title="American League">American League</a> (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason" title="Major League Baseball postseason">playoffs</a> that culminate in the <a href="/wiki/World_Series" title="World Series">World Series</a>. Five teams make the playoffs from each league: the three regular season division winners, plus two <a href="/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)" title="Wild card (sports)">wild card</a> teams. Baseball is the leading team sport in both Japan and Cuba, and the top level of play is similarly split between two leagues: Japan's <a href="/wiki/Central_League" title="Central League">Central League</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pacific_League" title="Pacific League">Pacific League</a>; Cuba's <a href="/wiki/Cuban_National_Series" title="Cuban National Series">West League and East League</a>. In the National and Central leagues, the pitcher is required to bat, per the traditional rules. In the American, Pacific, and both Cuban leagues, there is a tenth player, a <a href="/wiki/Designated_hitter" title="Designated hitter">designated hitter</a>, who bats for the pitcher. Each top-level team has a <a href="/wiki/Farm_team#Baseball" title="Farm team">farm system</a> of one or more <a href="/wiki/Minor_league_baseball" title="Minor league baseball" class="mw-redirect">minor league teams</a>.</p>

Straight from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball : Don't catch me for plagiarism.
    <p><b>Basketball</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Team_sport" title="Team sport">team sport</a>, the objective being to <a href="#Shooting">shoot</a> a <a href="/wiki/Basketball_(ball)" title="Basketball (ball)">ball</a> through a basket horizontally positioned to score points while following a set of <a href="/wiki/Rules_of_basketball" title="Rules of basketball">rules</a>. Usually, two teams of five players play on a marked rectangular <a href="/wiki/Basketball_court" title="Basketball court">court</a> with a basket at each width end. Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A regulation basketball hoop consists of a rim 18 inches (46&#160;cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.0&#160;m) high mounted to a <a href="/wiki/Backboard_(basketball)" title="Backboard (basketball)">backboard</a>. A team can score a <a href="/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)" title="Field goal (basketball)">field goal</a> by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal scores two points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the basket than the <a href="/wiki/3_point_line" title="3 point line" class="mw-redirect">three-point line</a>, and three points (known commonly as a <i>3 pointer</i> or <i>three</i>) if the player is behind the three-point line. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends with a draw. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running (<a href="/wiki/Dribbling" title="Dribbling">dribbling</a>) or throwing (<a href="/wiki/Passing_(sports)" title="Passing (sports)">passing</a>) it to a team mate. It is a violation to move without dribbling the ball (<a href="/wiki/Traveling_(basketball)" title="Traveling (basketball)">travelling</a>), to <a href="/wiki/Carrying_(basketball)" title="Carrying (basketball)">carry</a> it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling (<a href="/wiki/Double_dribble" title="Double dribble">double dribble</a>).</p>
<p>Various <a href="/wiki/Basketball#Violations" title="Basketball">violations</a> are generally called "fouls". Disruptive physical contact (a <a href="/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)" title="Personal foul (basketball)">personal foul</a>) is penalized, and a <a href="/wiki/Free_throw" title="Free throw">free throw</a> is usually awarded to an offensive player if he is fouled while shooting the ball. A <a href="/wiki/Technical_foul" title="Technical foul">technical foul</a> may also be issued when certain infractions occur, most commonly for <a href="/wiki/Unsportsmanlike_conduct" title="Unsportsmanlike conduct">unsportsmanlike conduct</a> on the part of a player or <a href="/wiki/Coach_(basketball)" title="Coach (basketball)">coach</a>. A technical foul gives the opposing team a free throw, and the opposing team is also retained possession of the ball.</p>
<p>Basketball has evolved many commonly used techniques of shooting, passing, dribbling, and rebounding, as well as specialized <a href="/wiki/Basketball_position" title="Basketball position" class="mw-redirect">player positions</a> and offensive and defensive structures (player positioning) and techniques. Typically, the tallest members of a team will play "<a href="/wiki/Center_(basketball)" title="Center (basketball)">center</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)" title="Power forward (basketball)">power forward</a>" or "<a href="/wiki/Small_forward" title="Small forward">small forward</a>" positions, while shorter players or those who possess the best ball handling skills and speed play "<a href="/wiki/Point_guard" title="Point guard">point guard</a>" or "<a href="/wiki/Shooting_guard" title="Shooting guard">shooting guard</a>".</p>
<p>While competitive basketball is carefully regulated, numerous <a href="/wiki/Variations_of_basketball" title="Variations of basketball">variations of basketball</a> have developed for casual play. Competitive basketball is primarily an indoor sport played on a carefully marked and maintained <a href="/wiki/Basketball_court" title="Basketball court">basketball court</a>, but less regulated variations are often played outdoors in both inner city and remote areas.</p>

This directory contains the two scripts needed to do a Jenkins
auto-integrate build, along with a test script, and duplication
for a current bug in git.

To use this, set up an auto-build in Jenkins, with the follwoing
config:
 * the github repository
 * a branch spec something like '**/dev-branch/**'
 * "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub"
 * Pre step: paste contents of auto-pre here. (add 'mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/tmp' for aura)
 * Post step (only if build succeeds): paste contents of auto-post here.

The parameters are in shell variables in the auto-pre and auto-post:
 * GIT: the path to the git command
 * INTEGRATE: the integration branch
 * COPY_TO: a list of integration 'branch' prefixes
   (e.g. touch-dev-branch would use "dev-branch")
